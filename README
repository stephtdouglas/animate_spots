Generate frames that can be turned into an animated .gif or movie file showing
a rotating star with a spot on it.

The generated image files have filenames ending in "%03d.jpg"

on Ubuntu, install libav-tools, and then the output files can be combined into
a movie using the following command:
avconv -framerate 5 -i <filebase>_%03d.jpg out.mov
